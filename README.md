# Photos Duplicates Remover
Simple `python sript` I used to manage my photos. I had about 10000 photos and about 5% of them had a duplicate with different name. This code has done the removing for me in a moment. I will probably add some GUI interface in future.

## Example usage:
* To list all duplicates in `PATH` directory: `./redup PATH S`
* To delete all duplicates in `PATH` directory `./redup PATH D`
